### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
